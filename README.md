## MSMamba

This repository will host the official implementation of **MSMamba: A Multi-Semantic Mamba Framework for Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation**.

🚧 **Code & data release plan**  
To comply with the review policy, we will make the full training/inference code, model checkpoints, and data preparation scripts publicly available **after the paper is accepted**.  
In the meantime, this repo is kept as a placeholder for reproducibility and will be updated immediately upon acceptance.

### What will be released
- Training and evaluation code
- Inference scripts
- Pre-trained checkpoints
- Data preparation instructions for RefSegRS / RRSIS-D / RISBench / RRSIS-HR
- Reproduction guides and configs
